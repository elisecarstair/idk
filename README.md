machine learning


A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network specifically designed for analyzing and processing images. It utilizes specialized layers called convolutional layers that can automatically learn and detect different features in an image, such as edges, textures, and shapes. By stacking these layers and applying pooling operations to downsample the learned features, CNNs can effectively recognize and classify objects within images. The hierarchical nature of CNNs allows them to learn complex representations and achieve impressive performance in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

An optimizer is like a "smart search algorithm" that helps machine learning models find the best settings or values for their internal knobs and buttons. These settings, called parameters, control how the model works and affect its performance. The optimizer explores different combinations of parameter values to minimize errors or maximize desired outcomes. For example, in an image recognition model, the parameters could determine how the model detects edges, shapes, and colors. By adjusting the parameters using an optimizer, the model can improve its accuracy and make more accurate predictions.
